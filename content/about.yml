  Hi, I'm **Martin Patino**, a Senior Software Engineer based in Phoenix, Arizona. With over five years at Sibi, I specialize in AWS serverless technologies, Node.js, and React to deliver scalable, user-centric solutions. I'm passionate about translating stakeholder needs into actionable development plans and empowering teams to achieve shared goals.

  ### Current Focus

  I'm currently leading the migration of the Sibi system to a serverless architecture on AWS, integrating technologies such as **SQS**, **EventBridge**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, and **CloudWatch**. I maintain client-facing web applications and mobile apps using **React Native**, and have implemented Sibi's entire payment service supporting multiple manufacturer workflows.

  I have extensive experience with multiple **AI projects**, focusing on **AI agents** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** for client usage. I prioritize keeping projects lean and cost-effective, avoiding bloated architectures that unnecessarily drive up expenses.

  ### Technical Expertise

  My expertise spans across full-stack development with a strong focus on:
  - **AWS Serverless Architecture**: Lambda, SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch
  - **AI & Machine Learning**: AI agents, MCP servers, AI-driven integrations
  - **Frontend**: React, React Native, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, HTML, CSS, SASS
  - **Backend**: Node.js, PHP, Elixir, Java SpringBoot
  - **Integration Services**: Primary developer for all integration services and data ingestion
  - **Messaging Systems**: Experience with RabbitMQ for messaging-driven architectures
  - **DevOps**: Docker, Heroku, CI/CD processes
  - **Cost Optimization**: Building lean, efficient systems that minimize operational costs

  ### Professional Journey

  Currently, I serve as **Senior Software Engineer at Sibi** (since December 2019) where I define product roadmaps with stakeholders and partner manufacturers, and as **Lead Software Engineer at Gizmodlabs** (since February 2019).

  Previously, I worked as:
  - **Senior Software Engineer at Torchlight Software** (2019) - Led as Agile SCRUM Master, architected CI/CD processes, and designed the MindMint product
  - **Software Engineer at NAGRA** (2018-2019) - Built frontend UI and backend API for myCinema, handled content encryption with Widevine
  - **Frontend Developer at Truman** (2017-2018) - Primary developer for cybersecurity startup using Vue.js, Nuxt, and Vuex
  - **Freelance Web Developer** (2016-2018) - Custom website design, CMS deployment (WordPress, Keystone.js)

  ### Education & Learning

  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Criminalistics and Criminal Science from Arizona State University (2012-2014), and have completed Full Stack Web Development certificates from Coursera and Free Code Camp (2015-2016).

  ### What Drives Me

  I'm dedicated to continuous learning and innovation, bringing technical proficiency and a collaborative mindset to every project. I thrive on solving complex problems through elegant technical solutions and working across all functional areas to gather inputs, update product plans, and communicate the impact of product decisions to stakeholders.
