            Hi, I'm <strong>Martin Patino</strong>, a Senior Software Engineer based in Phoenix, Arizona.
            I've spent the last five years at Sibi building serverless architectures on AWS, working with
            technologies like Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge, and React Native to create scalable systems
            that actually work in production.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm particularly interested in AI agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, where I focus
            on practical implementations that solve real problems. I believe in keeping systems lean and
            cost-effective—architecture should enable the business, not drain it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond my day job, I write about software development, serverless architecture, and the intersection
            of AI and practical engineering. When I'm not coding, I'm probably thinking about ways to simplify
            something that's too complicated.

          <p>
            At <strong>Sibi</strong>, I lead our serverless migration, designing and implementing the architecture
            that powers our platform. I work with stakeholders and partner manufacturers to define product roadmaps,
            then turn those conversations into working systems. I also maintain our payment service, which handles
            multiple manufacturer workflows across web and mobile platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            As <strong>Lead Software Engineer at Gizmodlabs</strong>, I focus on full-stack development and
            technical leadership, helping teams build better software through clean architecture and practical
            engineering practices.
