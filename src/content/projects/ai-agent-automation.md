## Overview

An AI-powered automation platform that uses intelligent agents to process and route complex business workflows. The system leverages OpenAI's models combined with custom logic to make decisions, categorize requests, and trigger appropriate actions.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Routing**: AI agents analyze incoming requests and automatically route them to the appropriate handlers
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Maintains conversation context across multiple interactions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on AWS Lambda for automatic scaling
- **Event-Driven Design**: Uses EventBridge for loose coupling and easy extensibility

## Technical Implementation

The system uses a serverless architecture on AWS:
- Lambda functions handle agent logic and API integrations
- DynamoDB stores conversation history and state
- EventBridge orchestrates workflow events
- Step Functions manage multi-step processes

## Results

- 70% reduction in manual processing time
- 95% accuracy in request categorization
- Handles 10,000+ requests per day
- Response time under 2 seconds

## Tech Stack

Node.js, OpenAI API, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Step Functions
